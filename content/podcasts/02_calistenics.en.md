  In this episode we discuss with our guest how to leave a well-paid 
job with carrier perspective in a corporate and launch your own business.
Why your attitude matters?  

  What does the "calisthenics" mean and why you should give it a chance?
And last but not least, how to make the sport classes not boring, 
but rather providing with more energy.

  Also, we will talk, how to make your carrier in stand-up comedy.
How to the jokes are being generated and how to overcome the stress 
before the performance.
