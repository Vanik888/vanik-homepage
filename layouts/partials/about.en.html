            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a data engineer and developer based in Cologne, Germany.
                <br /> I have more than 8 years experience in IT including QA,
                DevOps and Data Engineering.
                <br /> The last 7 years I was focused on the Data projects,
                building ML and Business Intelligence solutions for Amazon Vendors.
                Over the past seven years, I have been actively engaged in
                the development of diverse Data projects, specializing in the creation of Machine Learning and
                Business Intelligence solutions for Amazon Vendors and Sellers.
                Currently, I hold the position of Senior Data Engineer at N26,
                a leading German Neo bank in the FinTech sector, where I am responsible for the development
                of the companyâ€™s data platform.

                <br /> My professional journey has been focused on delivering cutting-edge
                data-driven solutions (DWH/Data Lakes/Lakehouse/Data Mesh),
                combining technical expertise with industry-specific knowledge.
                I have successfully implemented complex data engineering projects,
                leveraging advanced technologies to drive business value and operational efficiency.
                <br /> I enjoy learning new technologies and
                providing simple solutions to complex problems.
                <br /> In my free time I play traditional armenian instruments like
                bagpipe and pontian lyra and host a podcast about startups and IT in Armenia.
